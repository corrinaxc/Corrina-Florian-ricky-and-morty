# 3rd Spiced Project

## Description
This was the third project of the spiced full-stack bootcamp. It was a group-project, in which Corinna and Florian created a basic single page application using NextJS to search and display Rick and Morty characters.

## Key Learnings
- getting acquainted with React and NextJS' pages router
- fetching data from an external API and using components to render elements according to provided data
- applying complex CSS-styling like backgrounds, shadows, fonts and hovering effects
- implementing responsive design with flex-wrap for the display of cards

## Additional info
Aim of this challenge was to create an overview page. A detail's page for each card was not intended, but could be easily implented. The hovering effects over each card point towards this possibility.
